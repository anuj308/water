    <h2>What is the Water Cycle?</h2>
    <p>The water cycle shows the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. It is a complex system that includes many different processes. Liquid water evaporates into water vapor, condenses to form clouds, and precipitates back to earth in the form of rain and snow.</p>

    <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
    <p>The water cycle consists of several key processes:<br>

     <ol> <li> Evaporation: This is the process by which water is converted from its liquid state into water vapor (a gas) and enters the atmosphere. Evaporation occurs primarily from the Earth's oceans, but also from lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water, as well as from the surfaces of plants (transpiration) and soil.</li>
        
     <li> Condensation: As water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools and condenses back into liquid droplets to form clouds. This process is facilitated by the presence of tiny particles called condensation nuclei, around which water vapor can condense.</li>
        
    <li>Precipitation: When water droplets in clouds combine and grow large enough, they fall back to the Earth's surface as precipitation. Precipitation can take various forms, including rain, snow, sleet, and hail. The distribution and type of precipitation depend on factors such as temperature, air pressure, and atmospheric conditions.</li>
        
<li> Runoff: Precipitation that falls onto the Earth's surface may flow over the land as runoff, eventually reaching rivers, lakes, and oceans. Runoff also replenishes groundwater reserves and plays a crucial role in shaping landscapes through erosion and sediment transport.</li>
        
<li>Infiltration: Some precipitation infiltrates into the soil, where it is absorbed by plants or percolates downward to replenish groundwater aquifers. Infiltration is an essential process for maintaining soil moisture and sustaining ecosystems.</li>
        
<li>Transpiration: Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots and release it into the atmosphere through tiny pores in their leaves called stomata. This process, known as transpiration, contributes to the movement of water vapor from the land surface back into the atmosphere.</li>
        
        These processes interact dynamically, forming a continuous cycle that redistributes water across the Earth's surface and atmosphere. The water cycle plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate, shaping weather patterns, and sustaining life on the planet.
